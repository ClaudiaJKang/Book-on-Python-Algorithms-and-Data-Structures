## Book on Python, Algorithms, and Data Structures


This is a book about algorithms and data structure in Python. I wrote & open-sourced & sold it to [Hanbit Media](http://www.hanbit.co.kr/) in 2014. 

It's loosely based on the exercises & theory from the book [Cracking the Code Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850/).

- [Here is the PDF for the book](https://github.com/bt3gl/Python-and-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures/blob/master/First_edition_2014/ebook_pdf/book_second_edition.pdf).

- [Here is the source code, including abstract structures, bitwise operations, builtin Python data structures, searching and sorting, trees, and real interview problems](https://github.com/bt3gl/Book-on-Python-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures/tree/master/First_edition_2014/ebook_src).

- [Here are several samplings for coding challenges](https://github.com/bt3gl/Book-on-Python-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures/tree/master/First_edition_2014/other_resources), including [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/), [Top Coder](https://www.topcoder.com/challenges), [Interview Cake](https://www.interviewcake.com/), and [the eudyptula challenge](http://eudyptula-challenge.org/).

Even after the years, this book can be useful if you are aiming to learning Python and/or practicing for software engineering interviews.
